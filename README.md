This project uses HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript, NodeJS v20.16.0 and npm v10.8.1.

I used Docker via VSCode, please consult https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/quickstart-node

To run the project, you could create a Docker image, then run it in a container. The port is 3000, so it will run on http://localhost:3000/
You could also run it using "node server.js" in the terminal.
